XBMC4Gamers Synopsis Excel file can be used as an information tool for Xbox games. It has handy information like the Metacritic rating and you can filter by Genre etc.

It's main purpose however is for generating Synopsis information to be used in XBMC4Gamers (This synopsis information can be used with any XBMC 3.5.3 or above skin with Rocky5's custom synopsis script and custom XBMC xbe).

The information for the games is complete as much as possible for the entire US games list, however, the PAL and JAP information is not as complete. JAP especially.


The resources.xml file is every synopsis information in one file for reference. Also refer to the additional information PDF uploaded here with regards to editing the exported XML to allow the script to batch them without failing.


'Games' folder is the complete list of games with an _resources folder/default.xml file in each. These can be edited individually with your favourite .xml editor (Notepad++ or similar). They are ready to be put onto your Xbox HDD. Put the _resources folder into the root of each respective game on your HDD or add the default.xml files provided to your existing _resources folder if you already have them created. All information needed regarding _resources folder structure etc can be found on the XBMC4Gamers Github.


'Tools' folder (not required - here for reference):
Rocky5 did fantastic work creating an automated tool to create the individual synopsis files. Read the XBMC4Gamers Synopsis Spreadsheet Quick Guide for instructions.

The 'Schema and Map' folder within the 'Tools' folder should not be needed and is here for reference.


Many many thanks again to Rocky5, saved me a lot of copying and pasting!!!
Thanks also to CB Games (Cameron Brigman) - your list was a huge starting point!!!



Enjoy - Cian Cunningham
