# XBMC4Gamers-Synopsis-Information
Synopsis information for use with Rocky5's sublime XBMC4Gamers. These synopsis should be compatible with any XBMC 3.5.3 or above build once Rocky5's custom synopsis script and custom XBMC xbe are used. 

Download the 'Games.zip' for a HDD ready XBMC4Gamers Synopsis information setup. Transfer each resources folder to the root of your respective game folder on your Xbox or if you already have resources folders place the respective 'default.xml' in the root of your resources folder for each title. Resources folder/file structure example can be found on the XBMC4Gamers repository

Excel spreadsheet included with the most complete list of information for the complete Original Xbox games list. This was built from many online sources and defunct websites using the wayback machine. The synopsis is as complete as possible for the complete US released Xbox games list and most of the EU released games. It is slightly lacking for JAP titles. You can filter the spreadsheet by ratings, genre etc. It is a good tool for finding games. The primary building block for this spreadsheet was Cameron Brigmans EmuExtras list of Original Xbox games which is added as a tab for extra reference. All sources credited in the Sources tab in the Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet I created was used to generate the synopsis and Rocky5 created a batch tool to bulk extract them from the original Excel to xml export.

Resources.xml file is all synopsis in one file for quick reference.

Enjoy!!!
